title: "🗓️ Week 12 - Spatial Interpolation"
---

In this week, we will learn about *spatial interpolation*, a geostatistical technique for estimating values of continuous surfaces from point values sampled in the field.

## 👨‍🏫 Slides

You can find the slides [here](slides.qmd)

## R Practical

Detailed instructions are provided in the classroom. 

## ✍️ Informe No.2 

🚧 It should include two notebooks: *Geomorphometric terrain attributes* and   *Soil property interpolation*  🚧

# What is spatial interpolation


## Definition

Spatial interpolation is the estimation of values of spatially continuous variables (fields) for spatial locations where they have not been observed, based on known (observed) values.

## Geostatistics

Discipline concerned with modelling, estimation, and simulation of spatially continuous phenomena.

The typical problem is a missing value problem: from a limited number of observations of phenomenon Z(s) at samples $s_i$, we are interested in estimating values for unobserved locations.

## General equation

$Z_t$ is the estimated value at point t, $Z_i$ is the value observed in the i-th point and $N$ is the number of neighboring points that are used.

## Interpolation types

A *global* interpolation uses all available known points to estimate the unknown values. It produces smoother surfaces.

*Local* interpolation uses a sample of known points to estimate the unknown values. It captures the short-range variation.

# Methods

## Deterministic vs stochastic

Deterministic method are based on exactly *predetermined* functions that supposedly captures spatial similarity patterns.

Stochastic interpolation methods use *random* functions that quantifies the spatial autocorrelation among observations and account for the spatial configuration.

## Deterministic vs stochastic ...

Deterministic interpolation methods provide no assessment of errors with predicted values, while stochastic interpolation method offer assessment of predictions errors with estimated variances.

Deterministic interpolation methods include inverse distance weighted (IDW), modified Shepard, Spheremap and nearest neighbor.

Stochastic interpolation methods: ordinary kriging and universal kriging.

## Nearest Neighbor (NN)

The nearest neighbor method assigns the value from the nearest observation to a certain grid node. It is mostly applied in meteorology  and can give good results when using a dense station networks.

### IDW ...

The choice of  Œ≤ values affects the estimation quality. Higher values emphasize the influence of nearest points nearest to the grid node. Smaller values give more influence to distant points.

### IDW

The choice of the decorrelation distance 
affect the smoothness of the interpolated surface. A higher value of $d_0$ results in a more smoothed interpolated surface.

## Landforms

A landform is a discrete morphologic feature ‚Äî such as a watershed ‚Äî
that is  formed by a specific geomorphological. Each landform may be composed
of several landform elements.

# Algorithms

## Gradient

## Slope

The Slope is the steepness at each cell of a raster surface. The lower the slope value, the flatter the terrain; the higher the slope value, the steeper the terrain.

## Aspect


The Aspect is the direction the downhill slope faces. The values of each cell in the output raster indicate the compass direction the surface faces at that location.

In this week, we will learn about *spatial interpolation*, a geostatistical technique for estimating values of continuous surfaces from point values sampled in the field.

## 👨‍🏫 Slides

You can find the slides [here](slides.qmd)

## R Practical

Detailed instructions are provided on 12th February in the classroom. 

## ✍️ Informe No.2 deadline

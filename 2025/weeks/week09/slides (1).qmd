# Definitions

## What is a DEM?

A digital elevation model (DEM) is a general term representing ground elevation above sea level. In a DEM, all surface features (trees, buildings, bridges, etc.) are stripped away, and only the *bare earth* is represented. 

A DEM shows:

- Heights above sea level

- Slopes

- River beds

- Landforms

## What is a DTM?

A digital terrain model (DTM) is a layer ‚Äòon top‚Äô of the DEM. It will show additional information that the *bare earth* DEM might not represent, including things like:

- Breaklines are changes in the terrain on a surface 

- Manmade and natural linear features of the bare earth terrain, such as roads, railway tracks, flood defences, pipelines, coastlines, or rivers.

## What is a DSM?

A digital surface model (DSM) is a type of terrain that includes **all features above the bare earth** - both natural and man-made. 

It  includes ground features such as buildings, infrastructure, trees, and vegetation. The layer will represent the height of all these features above the ground on which they stand.

# Uses of topographic data

## Uses of DEMs & DTMs

DEMs and DTMs help us understand the ‚Äònatural‚Äô shape of the earth‚Äôs surface - without the ‚Äòdistraction‚Äô of buildings, trees, or other infrastructure. 

Both are especially useful for things like:

- Hydrology

- Terrain form

- Slope stability

- Simulations


## Uses of DSM

DSMs show you both ground elevation and the height of everything above it. This allows you to understand how ground features interact with one another and the bare earth. 

DSMs are useful for things like:

- Radio frequency planning

- Emergency planning

- Line of sight planning

- Smart city mapping

## Tecniques

Elevation data can be measured by:

- field surveying 

- photogrammetry 

- cartographic digitization

- airborne laser scanning

# Raster data in R

Let's practice. Create an R notebook using [this document](https://pages.cms.hu-berlin.de/EOL/gcg_quantitative-methods/Lab10_RasterData.html).

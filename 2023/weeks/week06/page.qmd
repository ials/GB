title: "🗓️ Week 06 - Data Wrangling **R**"
---

In this week, we will practice **Data Wrangling** 

## Why is data wrangling?

Data wrangling is the process of converting raw data into a usable form. It may also be called data munging or data remediation.

You'll typically go through the data wrangling process prior to conducting any data analysis in order to ensure your data is reliable and complete. This way, you can be confident that the insights you draw are accurate and valuable.


## 👨‍🏫 Lecture Slides 

In this week, we'll learn how to use the *dplyr* R library to conduct data wrangling. You can find info about *dplyr* [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)


## **Practical exercises**:

Students complete and publish two notebooks this week:

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

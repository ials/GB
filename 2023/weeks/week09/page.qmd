title: "🗓️ Week 09 - Join spatial and no spatial data"
---

In this week, we understand how to read, process, and analyze spatial data in R. 


## 👨‍🏫 Lecture Slides 

We'll learn:

- What are [*joins*](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html)

- What are main functionalities of the [simple features (sf) library](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/sf.pdf)


## **Practical exercises**:

Students complete one geospatial notebook:

#### Joins & thematic maps

## Homework
1. Publish your geospatial notebook not later than 10th October 2023
2. Create several geospatial data (i.e. points, lines and polygons ) using [geojson.io](https://geojson.io/) as explained in class
